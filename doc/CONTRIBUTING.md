# Contributing

## I want to contribute, where should I start?

I would say reading the README followed by the [Roadmap](https://github.com/aburd/beats-with-friends/wiki/Roadmap) is a good start. Find a feature or an issue you would like to work on. Once you find something you would like to do, check to see that there isn't already an issue already open on it. If there is an issue, then see if somebody isn't already actively working on it. If not, then post up and just check if you can take it. If there isn't an existing issue, then please open one and just briefly mention what you are working on and label it accordingly.

## Are there any rules about design and coding standards?

As of now, no not really. I expect this project to change a lot and even be re-written so I wouldn't be concerned, but understand that this project is not super stable at this time. 

## I found a bug, can I fix it?

Absolutely! Just make sure an issue is open regarding it and then fix it as necessary.

## I'm not sure what I should do, and these docs don't answer my questions...

Please open an issue with your question and I'll be glad to help you.
