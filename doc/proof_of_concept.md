## Goal

Beatmakers should understand the general concept of beats with friends. Collaborating with people should add to the experience, not detract from it. In addition, the experience of using it should be smooth (i.e. the beats made should sound fairly good). Performance must be as good as a DAW, even if it does not contain all the features of a DAW.
